# Vybe Engineering Workshop - GO Edition

In this edition of the Vybe Engineering Workshop, we'll be discussing Golang (GO). This repo provides a few examples of features that make GO very powerful and enjoyable to code in. This is not an exhaustive lesson on all the features GO provides. It is meant as a 15 minute primer on the language, the ecosystem, and how to deploy GO programs for production.

Before you get started, follow this tutorial to make sure your local environment is set up with the latest verison of GO.
